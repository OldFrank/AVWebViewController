Move images into a bundle
Internationalize: Change all UI strings to use NSLocalizedString
	Localize: Make localizations
Reliability: Make storing and retrieving of the currently-navigated URL more (100%, if possible) reliable
	"http://" should be stripped from the URL displayed in the action menu
	The action menu shouldn’t show strange URLs that are navigated by the web view load process, not the users
Do something intelligent when the network isn’t reachable
I would love there to be some sort of delegate protocol for sending links to Instapaper
Intelligently handle edge cases:
	Passing a URL without an HTTP or HTTPS should auto-prepend HTTP
	Save toolbar state:
		If the toolbar was already present, don’t remove it on pop
		Basically don’t mess with the toolbar
